# DATA STRUCTURES - A REVIEW

Through my path studying software devlopment i feel the need of review all the basic contents on the field. Data structures is one of the main subjects to be learn in Software Devlopment courses from any educational institute. Because of that, those knoledge will be the founding blocks of a solid formation. During the carrer of any software devloper would appear challenges that will need a broad knoledge in data structures. Which date structure is more suitable for addresses? Which one is faster when i have a massive data base to access? Those questions would be easily aswered knowing all the main data structures and those characteristics.

## Objectives

The main goal with this project is to practice my knowledge in data structures and algorithms. Also, this project would provide me practice in the programming language aswell in git usage. 

### Why C++?

C++ allows the usage of pointers, which would be usefull during manipulation of the elements inside the structures. Besides, i like to challenge myself.
Another good feature of C++ is the object-oriented nature of the language. That would allow me to create objects and interfaces simulating those data structures from others programming languages.

### Inspiration

This project is heavily inpired by the Java Collections Framework, so i am using all those classes as reference in this project.

## Final considerations 

None of those implementations are practical to be used in any real application. I acknowledge that would be a lot of mistakes made during the development of this project, but, as i grow my confidence on coding, i will fix those problems as soon as i am aware of it.
